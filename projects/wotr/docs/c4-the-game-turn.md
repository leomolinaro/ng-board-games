## CHAPTER IV: THE GAME TURN
|  |  |  |
|---|---|---|
|  | WOTR.4.1 | **SUMMARY OF THE TURN** The phases of the turn are: Phase 1) Recover Action Dice and Draw Event Cards, Phase 2) Fellowship Phase, Phase 3) Hunt Allocation, Phase 4) Action Roll, Phase 5) Action Resolution, Phase 6) Victory Check. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | **ACTION DICE POOL** The Shadow player starts the game with seven dice in his pool. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | But may gain additional dice later in the game, up to a maximum of ten. These additional Action Dice enter play when the Shadow player brings his Minions into the game (one die for Saruman, one for the Witch-king, one for the Mouth of Sauron). |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | The Free Peoples player starts with four dice in his pool. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | The Free Peoples player adds one die to his dice pool when Aragorn – Heir to Isildur enters play and another one when Gandalf the White appears. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | Both the Shadow and the Free Peoples player lose the additional die if the corresponding Character is eliminated. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | When a player gains or loses an Action Die, the gain or loss becomes effective in the next turn: the die is added to, or removed from, the dice pool during the Recover Action Dice and Draw Event Cards phase of the following turn. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | **HUNT ALLOCATION AND ACTION ROLL** The Shadow player, during the Hunt Allocation Phase, places the number of Action Dice into the Hunt Box that he wants to devote to the Hunt for the Ring. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | If one or more Fellowship Action Dice were in the Hunt Box at the end of the previous turn, he must place a minimum of 1 die in the Hunt Box. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | The maximum number of dice he can place in the Hunt Box is equal to the number of Companions currently in the Fellowship (note that the Ring-bearers are not considered to be a Companion and do not add to this maximum). |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | However, the Shadow player may always place at least one die in the Hunt Box, even if all the Companions have left the Fellowship. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | The dice placed in the Hunt Box are not rolled, but the Shadow player rolls the remaining dice in his dice pool, and all dice showing an “Eye” result are immediately added to the Hunt Box as well. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | The Free Peoples player simply rolls his entire Action Dice pool. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | **USING ACTION DICE** Starting with the Free Peoples. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | Players alternate actions selecting one of their Action Dice and immediately taking the action made available by the specific die result. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | When an action has been completed, the corresponding die is considered “used” and is set aside until needed again for the next turn. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | The only exception to this rule is that each time the Free Peoples player uses an Action Die to move the Fellowship, he places that die in the Hunt Box after completing the action rather than setting it aside. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | If a player has fewer unused Action Dice than his opponent, he can pass instead of taking an action, thus allowing the opponent to take another action. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | A player may also choose to skip an action and discard one of his Action Dice without effect, instead of using that die to take an action. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | If a player runs out of actions before his opponent has done the same, the opponent executes his remaining actions one after the other. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | **THE ELVEN RINGS** When the Free Peoples player uses an Elven Ring, he flips over the counter to show its “Flaming Eye” side and gives it to the Shadow player. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | After the Shadow player uses the counter, it is discarded from play. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | When a player is about to take an action during the Action Resolution phase, he may use an Elven Ring to change the result shown on one of his unused Action Dice to another Action Die result of his choice. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | A player that just used an Elven Ring to change a die result then proceeds to take a regular action, choosing any one Action Die result (not necessarily the one he has just changed with the Elven Ring). |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | Only one Elven Ring may be used by the same player during the course of a single turn. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | The Free Peoples player may not use an Elven Ring to change an action die to a “Will of the West” result. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | The Shadow player can use an Elven Ring to change a die result into an “Eye” result (that die is immediately moved to the Hunt Box). |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | This does not count as an action, so he may then take an action normally. |
|  | WOTR.4.1 | However, he cannot do the opposite and use an Elven Ring to change the result of an action die already showing an “Eye” result. |
