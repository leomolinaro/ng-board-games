## CHAPTER V: THE EVENT CARDS
|  |  |  |
|---|---|---|
|  | WOTR.5.1 | **DRAWING EVENT CARDS** During the first phase of each game turn (including the first turn) both players must draw one card from each of their decks. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | It is also possible for players to draw cards from either deck by using an Action Die result during the Action Resolution phase. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | Players may hold a maximum of six cards in their hand at any time and must immediately discard those in excess as soon as the maximum number is exceeded. Cards are discarded face down. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | If a deck is depleted during the game, the discarded cards are not reshuffled. It is now no longer possible for the player to draw cards out of that deck. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | **PLAYING EVENT CARDS** Event Cards can be played during the Action Resolution phase in two ways: by using an Event Action Die result, |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | or by using an Action Die result whose icon matches the symbol on the upper right corner of the card. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | Generally, Event Cards are discarded as soon as their effects are resolved. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | Often, some kind of requirement must be met for the effects of the card to apply; if a requirement is not fully satisfied, the card cannot be played. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | If a card reads “Play on the table”, it means that the card is not discarded after it is played, and its effects last until a particular condition or requirement is met after which the card is discarded. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | If discarding a card requires the use of an Action Die, discarding the card counts as an action. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | Note that if the condition required to play such a card ceases to be met, the card is immediately discarded. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | If a card text directs you to “recruit” units or Leaders, these units or Leaders are taken from your available reinforcements. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | The actions indicated by an Event Card are mandatory. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | However, it can happen that the effects of an Event Card cannot be fully applied. In this case, the card can still be played, and its effects are applied to the maximum extent possible. |
|  | WOTR.5.1 | **Event Cards Provoking Casualties** Several cards describe effects that may cause a player to remove some figures from play. If all the Army units in an Army are eliminated by the effect of such a card, all Free Peoples Leaders with the Army are immediately removed, while any Nazgûl, Companions, or Minions are left in the region, unless specified differently in the card text. |
